Angular 7 CRUD with Asp.Net Core Web API

CRUD Operations - Insert, update, delete and retrieve are implemented in Asp.Net Core Web API with Angular 7. First of all we'll build a Web API project in Asp.Net Core with required methods at server side using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server DB. Then Angular 7 Project consumes those methods from client side.

Points discussed :
 - How to create Web API in Asp.Net Core with CRUD web methods.
 - Enable CORS in Asp.Net Core.
 - Angular Form Design with Validation.

Tools Used : VS Code, Visual Studio, SSMS, Postman.
